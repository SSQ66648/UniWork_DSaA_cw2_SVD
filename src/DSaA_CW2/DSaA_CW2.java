 *  Title:              DSaA_CW2
 *
 *  Description:        Class contains timing experiments for part2_5
 *                      (inserting n random elements into arrayhashtable,
 *                      and their removal)

 *  Version history:    v1.0    190219  initial implementation of class
 *                      v1.1    190301  parts 1_ and 1_2
 *                      v1.2    190308  part 1_3 using hashmap - deleted
 *                      v1.3    190311  part 1_3 using moores voting algorithm
 *                      v1.3.1  190311  reformatted file and test harness output
 *                      v1.4    190312  abstracted all algorithms to own class
 *                      v2.0    190316  class currently unused. Intending to 
 *                                      implement run code for all experiments
 *                                      here.
 *
 *  Notes:
 *                      As mentioned in other class notes, this class as to be 
 *                      used as the main to run the single timing experiment
 *                      by passing algorithms or even the ArrayHashTable as well
 *                      via polymorphism. This is not currently implemented, but
 *                      may be in future versions of these experiments.
